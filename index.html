	<h1>Hi, I'm Lillian!</h1>
		<p>I am a <strong> Computer Network Defender </strong> interested in computer forensics, threat emulation and incident investigations for Advanced Persistent Threats</p>
		<p> So what is it that actually do?  </p>
		<p>I find innovative ways to test applications and architecture for readiness. I hunt for APTs. I report and present my team's findings </p>
	<h4>Technical hobbies</h4>
                <p> I love playing Capture the Flag challenges and learning about Social Engineering. </p>
