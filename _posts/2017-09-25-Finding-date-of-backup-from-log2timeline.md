I was given a log2timeline .csv output and asked when the laptop was reimaged. Uhhhhhh. What do to?
A coworker suggested graphing the dates from the log2timeline entries. 
Sure enough there was a clear delineation of when the dates stopped jumping and became a sloped line of steady entries. 
I would have never thought to graph the dates!
