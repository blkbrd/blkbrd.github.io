I never learned Python in my degree (Computer Science), but I used it a few times in school and at work and 
was always amazed at how easy it made tasks. With the goal of increasing my Python proficiency, I am spending 
time coding whatever I can in Python. Yesterday I learnt that you can interact with Excel and OpenOffice Calc in Python!

its as easy as... 
<code> 
>>>import openpyxl
>>>wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('NAME.xlsx')
>>>sheet1 = wb.get_sheet_by_name('SHEET_NAME')
</code>
you can do whatever data analytics and transformations your heart desires! 

<p>
I'm a little too excited about this revelation...
