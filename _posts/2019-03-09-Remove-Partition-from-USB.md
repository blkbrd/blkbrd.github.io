title: "Remove Partitions"

Today I learned how to remove partition from a thumb drive (which I was way too excited about). 
<p>
Open a command prompt, run <code>diskpart</code>, then <code>list disk</code>, select your USB thumbdrive with <code>select disk X</code> 
(where X cooresponds to your device. Check the size to verify you're picking the right one), 
look at existing partitions with <code>list partition</code>. 
<p>
<p>From here you can either go through and delete what you want using <code>select</code> and <code> delete </code> commands or use 
<code>clean</code> if you dont want to select each partition. 
<p>Once you're done with that, use <code>create partition primary</code> and youre
done! Exit with the <code>exit</code> command. 
<p>
I love sysadmin skills, lol!
