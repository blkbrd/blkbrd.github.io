I needed to manipulate a photo for a CTF challenge awhile back, so I took some extra time today to learn the basics of photo manipulation in Python. 
I put the basic code and comments in the CTF scripts repository, [here](https://github.com/blkbrd/CTF-Scripts/blob/master/photoEditing.py)
Very helpful tools!
